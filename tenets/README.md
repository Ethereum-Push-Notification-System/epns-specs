#Tenets
What we want to focus on, growing document.

1. Security - Users need to be protected, their notifications (especially secrets) should be only accessible to them.
2. User Experience - Users should be expected to do minimal things in setup or otherwise, every things should be automagical.
3. Decentralization - Every mapping, settings, notifications, etc should be stored (indirectly - ipfs, etc or directly) on decentralized solutions. ie: aim to be platform agnostic.
4. Flexibility - Features should work exactly the same anywhere regardless of the platform user is on. ie: dApp, Mobile App, Web3 Providers, etc.
5. Low Cost / Protocol Optimization - The protocol should be optimized in every way possible to decrease the cost to the user without compromising on features.
