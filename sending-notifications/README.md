# Sending Notifications

## High Level Application Flow

EPNS uses the following application flow to ensure storage, broadcasting and sending of notifications.

![High Level Application Flow](../.gitbook/assets/highlevel.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
 Abstracting the data layer on chain \(directly or indirectly\) ensures notifications are platform agnostic. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
In the future, we might even support other centralized services apart from Mobile, Tablet, Chrome, Firefox, favorite user wallets, etc. 

As a service, these are automatically enabled for you as and when we integrate them.
{% endhint %}
